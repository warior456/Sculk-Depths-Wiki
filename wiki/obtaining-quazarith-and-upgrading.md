## Upgrading tools
1. First you will need to craft a Flumrock Cauldron

2. Next you will need to find Kryslum in a structure or at the bottom of the world and collect quite a bit (a bucket for each slot your tool or armor takes in the crafting table)

5. Finally right click your Netherite tools or armor on the cauldron

## Notes: 
* The amount of Quazarith and Crux needed to upgrade it depends on the amount of slots the main material takes up in the crafting table
  * helmet cost = 5
  * chestplate cost = 8
  * leggings cost = 7
  * boots cost = 4
  * shovel cost = 1
  * pickaxe cost = 3
  * ...
* A Flumrock Cauldron can store a maximum of 12 Crux, Quazarith Pieces and Kryslum Buckets
